0x0C. Web server

In this project, some of the tasks will be graded on 2 aspects:

Is your web-01 server configured according to requirements
Does your answer file contain a Bash script that automatically performs commands to configure an Ubuntu machine to fit requirements (meaning without any human intervention)
For example, if I need to create a file /tmp/test containing the string hello world and modify the configuration of Nginx to listen on port 8080 instead of 80, I can use emacs on my server to create the file and to modify the Nginx configuration file /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

But my answer file would contain:

sylvain@ubuntu cat 88-script_example
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Configuring a server with specification XYZ
echo hello world > /tmp/test
sed -i 's/80/8080/g' /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
sylvain@ubuntu
As you can tell, I am not using emacs to perform the task in my answer file. This exercise is aiming at training you on automating your work. If you can automate tasks that you do manually, you can then automate yourself out of repetitive tasks and focus your energy on something more interesting. For an SRE, that comes very handy when there are hundreds or thousands of servers to manage, the work cannot be only done manually. Note that the checker will execute your script as the root user, you do not need to use the sudo command.

A good Software Engineer is a lazy Software Engineer.

Tasks
0. Transfer a file to your server
mandatory
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:

Requirements:

Accepts 4 parameters
The path to the file to be transferred
The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
The username scp connects with
The path to the SSH private key that scp uses
Display Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY if less than 3 parameters passed
scp must transfer the file to the user home directory ~/
Strict host key checking must be disabled when using scp
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file
Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/sylvain 'ls ~/'
afile
sylvain@ubuntu$ 
sylvain@ubuntu$ touch some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file some_page.html 8.8.8.8 sylvain /vagrant/private_key
some_page.html                                     100%   12     0.1KB/s   00:00
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
afile
some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$
In this example, I:

remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see what ~/ contains
create a file named some_page.html
execute my 0-transfer_file script
remotely execute the ls ~/ command via ssh to see that the file some_page.html has been successfully transferred
That is one way of publishing your website pages to your server.
